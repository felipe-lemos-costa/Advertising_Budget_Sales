# Summary
This project analyzes the relationship between investments in different advertising channels (TV, radio, and newspapers) and their impact on company sales. The goal is to understand how each channel contributes to sales performance, using advertising budgets as explanatory variables and sales volume as the target variable.

# Key Insights
1. Analyzing the Sales histogram, we observed a slightly higher concentration to the left, with a slight tail to the right:

2. The correlation matrix revealed a strong positive correlation between Sales and TV Ad Budget, indicating that higher investments in TV ads are associated with higher sales. On the other hand, the correlation with Radio Ad Budget showed a moderate positive correlation, while the correlation with Newspaper Ad Budget exhibited a weak positive correlation:

3. The line chart displays the correlation between the variables, ordered from the most strongly correlated (TV Ad Budget) to the least correlated(Radio Ad Budget).

4. In the scatter plots, the most notable feature is the strong positive correlation between Sales and TV Ad Budget. The plots of Sales compared to Radio Ad Budget showed greater dispersion, while the plots of Sales versus Newspaper Ad Budget displayed even greater dispersion.

5. The analysis of the boxplot visually revealed the presence of two outliers in the Newspaper Ad Budget. These outliers could be explained by special events or campaigns where a large investment in ads was made for specific occasions.
