# Summary
This project analyzes the relationship between investments in different advertising channels (TV, radio, and newspapers) and their impact on company sales. The goal is to understand how each channel contributes to sales performance, using advertising budgets as explanatory variables and sales volume as the target variable.

2. The correlation matrix revealed a strong positive correlation between Sales and TV Ad Budget, indicating that higher investments in TV ads are associated with higher sales. On the other hand, the correlation with Radio Ad Budget showed a moderate positive correlation, while the correlation with Newspaper Ad Budget exhibited a weak positive correlation:
